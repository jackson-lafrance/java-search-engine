Project Background
In 1405Z, you implemented a web crawler and search engine in Python. One of the
main goals for the 1406 project is to re-implement this functionality in Java using object-
oriented programing. The class design and overall implementation details for the 1406
project will be your responsibility. While the focus of the 1405 project was on optimizing
the computational complexity of your search, the focus of the 1406 problem will be on
creating a solid OOP design and implementation. Along with the crawl and search
functionality from the 1405 project, your 1406 project must also include:
1. A GUI application that allows the user to perform searches and see search
results. This must be implemented using the MVC paradigm covered in the
course. The overall design of the view is flexible. It does not have to look fancy,
but it should be organized well and easy to use. The view component of the GUI
application must include at least:
a. A text field for entering a search query
b. A button to execute a search (alternatively, you can automatically update
the search results when the text in the search field or the PageRank boost
option is changed).
c. A way for the user to indicate whether PageRank boost should be used or
not (e.g., a radio button element).
d. A list of the top 10 search results for the current query, sorted by their
overall search score (from highest to lowest). Each search result must
show the name of the page and the current search score for that page.
2. A class that implements the ProjectTester interface included on the project’s
Brightspace page. This class must be named ProjectTesterImp. This class will
allow automated tests to be run on your project. Note that this class must support
the required methods but will almost certainly create instances of your other
classes (e.g., a crawler, a search engine, etc.) to perform the computations and
return the results. In a way, you can look at this class as providing a connection
between your classes and the automated testing. Each method defined in this
interface includes a comment describing how that method should work. This is
especially important for the search method, which differs slightly from the 1405
requirements.
3. A project report PDF that includes the following:

a. Instructions for running your GUI (i.e., which class is the controller).
b. A list of functionality you have completed successfully and a list of the
functionality that does not work.
c. An outline of each of your classes/interfaces/etc. that explains the main
responsibility of each file in your project.
d. Discussion about the overall design of your system. You should discuss
how you have applied the OOP principles in your project and how this has
improved the overall quality of your implementation (think about
modularity, extensibility, etc.). You should also include a description of
how you have saved your data in files. You do not have to provide formal
runtime complexity analysis but can discuss what steps you took to
improve the efficiency of your application. Within the report, don’t solely
describe how you did something. You should also focus on explaining why
you did it this way. Include arguments to support your decisions (e.g., why
is this a good approach? what are its advantages? why is it better than
alternatives? etc.).
Constraints and Assumptions
1. You will submit only the .java files required for your project. You are free to
develop the project in whatever IDE or editor you choose. You should not use
any build tools, etc., for the project.
2. You must not modify any of the provided classes or interfaces.
3. The crawler must save all required information to files. It should be possible to
run a crawl, stop the program, and run several searches later without re-running
the crawler.
4. All files must be saved within the project using relative paths. You must also use
the OS-agnostic file separator to ensure your code works when moved to another
computer.
5. You may use any built-in Java/JavaFX functionality. You may not use any other
external libraries.
6. (The remainder of the assumptions and constraints are the same as those
provided in the 1405 project specification) You may assume the HTML is
well-formatted (e.g., each <a> or <p> tag has a matching closing </a> or </p>
tag).
7. You may assume that there will be no additional HTML inside of the <a>...</a>
or <p>...</p> tags.
8. There may be an arbitrary amount of <p> tags and links included in the page and
they may be in any particular order within the page.
9. You may assume that all links include an “href” property and the link location is
contained inside quotation marks after href= inside of the link definition.

10. You may assume that the title for a page will be the text in between the <title>
and </title> tags within the page. You may not assume the title matches the
last part of the URL for the page or that the titles are unique.
11. Each URL will contain either an absolute or a relative URL. All absolute URLs will
start with "https://". Links that do not start with "https://" will be relative links and
you will have to compute the full URL using a combination of the link address and
the current page URL. You may assume that all relative links will start with "./".
You may not assume that all pages share the same base URL (e.g.,
https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~avamckenney/tinyfruits/) and will have to
programmatically build the URL using the current page’s URL and the relative
link.
12. You may assume that all words within a page will be contained between a <p>
start tag and </p> end tag. Words may be separated by spaces or new-line
characters (i.e., "\n"). You should not consider link text or titles as part of the
words on the page.
13. Pages may have any simple String name.
Test Files
Test files like those provided for the 1405 project are included in the test-resources.zip
file. These test files will interact with your class that implements the ProjectTester
interface. There will be six different datasets that you can test your implementation on
(tinyfruits, fruits25, fruits50, fruits100, fruitsA, and tinyfruitsA). If you want to test your
program manually, you can start your crawl at the following links to crawl the pages
associated with each dataset:
1. https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~avamckenney/tinyfruits/N-0.html
2. https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~avamckenney/fruits25/N-0.html
3. https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~avamckenney/fruits50/N-0.html
4. https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~avamckenney/fruits100/N-0.html
5. https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~avamckenney/fruitsA/N-0.html
6. https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~avamckenney/tinyfruitsA/N-0.html
The tiny datasets contain only 10 interlinked web pages and are good starting points to
test your crawler/search functionality.
Submission
Submit a single .zip file named “project.zip” to Brightspace. This zip file should contain
all of your .java files for the project and your analysis report in PDF format. Download
your submission afterward and check the contents to ensure everything uploaded as
expected. You should verify that your project still works correctly after being extracted

from the zip file. Consider running the tests again on the downloaded zip to ensure you
get the expected resultss
